					<p>At <span class="text-regular">Safety First,</span> we offer a host of services for adult drivers. Regardless of your age or level of experience, we have a driver training program that will benefit you!
</p>
					<div class="text1 right-h2"><h2>Need a License?</h2>
					<p>Do you already have your permit but feel you need more experience before you would be able to pass a road test? Let Safety First assess your skills behind the wheel and make recommendations for additional driver training if you need it. We can also set up your road test, pick you up for it and let you take your test in one of our vehicles. </p>

					<div class="text1"><h2>Are You a Nervous Driver?</h2>
					<p>Nervous drivers are dangerous drivers. A little confidence can go a long way in keeping you and everyone else in your driving environment safe with you behind the wheel. We'll assess your skills, talk to you about the things that make you nervous, zero in on the areas you need to work on, and put together a program tailored to your individual needs. We'll start with the basics and gradually work you up to driving in increasingly difficult environments and scenarios. </p>
					</div> <!--text 1-->
					<div class="text-3">
					<h2>Need a Refresher?</h2>
					<p>We offer training for licensed drivers who want to develop better skills or gain a deeper understanding of the rules of the road.</p>
					</div><!--text 3-->
					<div class="text-3">
					<h2>New to California? </h2>
					<p>First off, welcome! We're glad you're here and we know that you are going to love living in SoCal. Whatever brings you here, it is important to realize that traffic laws vary between states. You are responsible for knowing the law in the state where you hold your driver's license but written exams and road tests only address a minuscule percentage of them. We offer comprehensive training that will familiarize you with all pertinent rules and laws in California and the greater United States.</p>
					</div><!--text 3-->
					<div class="text1">
					<h2>If you are new to the country and hold a license from somewhere outside the United States, keep reading...</h2>
					</div><!--text 5-->
					<div class="text-3">
					<h2>Do You Hold a Foreign or International Driver's License?</h2>
					<p>The rules of the road vary drastically throughout the world. If you plan to set up residence in California it is vital that you learn the rules of the road that are basic to all 50 states as well as those specific to your newly adopted home. Whatever dreams you are pursuing relocating to SoCal, your first priority should be the ability to get from one place to another independently and safely. Let Safety First show you how.</p>
						
						
					</div><!--text 3-->
					<div class="text-3">
					<h2>Are you a Senior Over 70?</h2>
					<p>New laws in California require that you take and pass a road test every two years to maintain driver licensure. Driving environments and methods – even cars themselves – have changed considerably over time.  Even if you've had a perfect driving record for decades you could still benefit from a greater understanding of the rules of the road and how to operate successfully in a variety of scenarios. </p></div>
					
					<div class="text-3">
						<p>Don't risk failing your road test, especially if this is your first one in years. Let us help ensure that you have the skills necessary to pass the first time.</p>
