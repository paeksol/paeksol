				<h2 class="teen-h5">What You Need To Know about your teen and Driver's Ed</h2>
					<p>The first toward getting a driver's license in California is <span class="italic">obtaining a permit</span>. There are a number of steps in this process, but the simple breakdown looks like this: </p>
					<p class="padding-cus">Your teen MUST complete all of the following to qualify for a permit:</p>
					<ul>
					<li><span><img src="/media/img/arrow-left.png" alt=""/></span> Be at least 15 years, 6 months old </li>
					<li><span><img src="/media/img/arrow-left.png" alt=""/></span> Take and pass the state-administered online driver education test</li>
					<li><span><img src="/media/img/arrow-left.png" alt=""/></span> Take and pass the DMV-administered written test for obtaining the permit</li>
					<li><span><img src="/media/img/arrow-left.png" alt=""/></span> Take an on-road driving lesson with a certified driver education instructor. The instructor will validate the permit.</li>
					<li class="p-tag"><p>So going through Driver's Ed and getting the permit are the biggest hurdles, but there is more to it than that.</p></li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="clearfix"></div>
					<div class="text1"><h2>This is Where YOU come in!</h2>
					<p>Once your teen has his or her permit, the state of California expects you to do your part. Prior to qualifying for licensure, the candidate must complete – and document – 50 hours of on-road practice with an adult driver who is licensed in California. He or she also needs to have held a valid permit for at least six months before qualifying for a road test. </p>
					</div> <!--text 1-->
					<div class="text-2 second-page">
					<h2>DRIVER EDUCATION BEYOND THE PERMIT</h2>
					<p>You don't have to take a single driving lesson or clock a specific number of hours behind the wheel like teen drivers in California. As an adult, all you have to do is prove that you can control the car and that you have a basic understanding of the rules of the road, NEITHER OF WHICH MAKE YOU A SAFE DRIVER.</p>
					</div><!--text 2-->
					<div class="text-4">
					<p>We recommend investing in a comprehensive driver training program that will better equip your teen for the many circumstances they will encounter on the road. With more on-road training, your son or daughter will learn firsthand how to deal with unexpected circumstances and avoid making many of mistakes common for inexperienced drivers. Extra hours of professional instruction can better equip your teen for all the variables associated with driving and avoid dangerous situations before they happen. </p>

					<h2>SAFETY FIRST: Developing safe, teen drivers in California is our primary goal</h2>
					<p>There are few things in life that are more important than developing good habits behind the wheel. No matter what, driving always carries with it a degree of risk. The goal of a solid driver's ed program is to MINIMIZE the risk by helping your teen develop habits from the first time they sit behind the wheel that define the concept of Defensive Driving. A driver who understands that concept is a safe driver and at Safety First, our name speaks of our unwavering commitment to teaching it by example.</p>
