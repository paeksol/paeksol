					<p>Are you tired of using public transportation? FACT:  The cost of upkeep and maintenance on a car in California is comparable to what you would pay to use public transport. Depending on where you live and where you have to travel, relying on cabs and buses can actually cost more. This makes the benefits of having a car and a license to drive in California clear. </p>
					<h2>Here are just a few of the reasons why you should choose to get your California driver's license:</h2>
					<ul>
					<li><span><img src="/media/img/arrow-left.png" alt=""/></span> More freedom of movement</li>
					<li><span><img src="/media/img/arrow-left.png" alt=""/></span> Get to work and take care of personal business on your preferred schedule</li>
					<li><span><img src="/media/img/arrow-left.png" alt=""/></span> No waiting for buses or hailing cabs</li>
					<li><span><img src="/media/img/arrow-left.png" alt=""/></span> No inconvenient routes or drop-off points</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="clearfix"></div>
					<div class="text1"><h2>But the biggest reason by far is that, as an adult, the state makes it easy for you to get your license. It's a simple two-step process:</h2>
					<p>1. Obtain a permit (by passing a written test)</p>
					<p>2. Pass a DMV administered road test</p>
					</div>
					<div class="text-2">
					<h2>It's True...</h2>
					<p>You don't have to take a single driving lesson or clock a specific number of hours behind the wheel like teen drivers in California. As an adult, all you have to do is prove that you can control the car and that you have a basic understanding of the rules of the road, NEITHER OF WHICH MAKE YOU A SAFE DRIVER.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="text-3">
					<h2>Why You Need Driving Lessons</h2>
					<p>Even the most conscientious adults never really know the kinds of challenges they can face on the open road until they've been out there driving in real traffic, encountering real problems and dealing with them in real time. 
Make no mistake: what you don't know CAN hurt you (or kill you). There are many things about driving that you might not have considered and there are numerous laws which adult operators in California need to understand and follow. Only a TINY percentage of these are addressed in the written or on-road tests. There is more to learn than “red means stop and green means go.” If you don't know the rules of the road or how to follow them defensively, you will soon find out that simply being able to control the car is not enough. Not by a long shot.</p>
						<h2>Our comprehensive driver training program provides you with skills that will help you:</h2>
						<ul>
						<li><span><img src="/media/img/arrow-left.png" alt=""/></span> Learn how to avoid accidents and tickets by teaching you the rules of the road</li>
						<li><span><img src="/media/img/arrow-left.png" alt=""/></span> Learn how to spot potential problems before they occur and deal with them safely</li>
						<li><span><img src="/media/img/arrow-left.png" alt=""/></span> Develop better reflexes and recognize details you may never have considered as a passenger</li>
						<li><span><img src="/media/img/arrow-left.png" alt=""/></span> Gain confidence in your ability to drive safely</li>
						<li><span><img src="/media/img/arrow-left.png" alt=""/></span> Learn how to drive in a broad range of environments</li>
						</ul>

					<p>We also have different skills development programs for all levels of experience:
Beginner Training – Are you a nervous driver?  Do you lack the confidence necessary to become a safe driver on your own?

We start off with simple driving scenarios and gradually increase the difficulty over time. As your confidence grows, the challenges increase. You will graduate quickly from side streets and intersections to heavy traffic situations and freeways. You will be amazed at how much you learn and in how little time.</p>

					<p><span>Senior Driver Training –</span>Drivers over the age of 70 are required to retake the California DMV-administered road test every two years. Even if you have a totally clean record and have had one for decades, the way people drive and the laws governing how they drive change over time. We teach today's seniors how to properly negotiate traffic in today's fast-paced driving environments and provide honest and fair skills assessments to determine the best course of training. We then administer a series of mock road tests to make sure they are familiar with what will be expected of them on test day. </p>
