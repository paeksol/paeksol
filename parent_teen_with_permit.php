				<h2 class="teen-h5">“Why is helping my teenager get a driver's license so important?”</h2>
					<p>For most teens, a driver's license is practically a rite of passage. It is the fist real step they take into adulthood. For the first time, they are fully responsible for their own safety and accountable for their own actions.</p>
					<p>
Achieving driver licensure is an important part of your teen's emotional development. It will also help them develop a sense of maturity and responsibility that few other things in life can teach quite as well. </p>

					<div class="text1"><h2>Safety First – Developing Safe Drivers in California</h2>
					<p>Make no mistake: if you are afraid to let your teen get a license or are afraid to drive with them on your own, you are creating an environment of fear for them that can lead to trouble down the line.<span class="text-regular">Nervous drivers are dangerous drivers, confident drivers are safe drivers.</span> Let us help your teen develop the confidence he or she needs to be safe behind the wheel.</p>
					</div> <!--text 1-->
					<div class="text-3">
					<h2></h2>
					<p>Let Safety First help alleviate some of the anxiety of “cutting the cord” and reinforce what they learn behind the wheel with you through additional hours of professional on-road instruction. It is never easy watching our sons and daughters grow and mature, but a little peace of mind goes a long way when it comes to teens and driving. Our on-road instruction packages will give you that peace of mind and develop your teen's confidence in his or her own abilities often faster than simply driving with a parent. </p>

					<h2>THE POSSIBILITES ARE ENDLESS! </h2>
					<p>Does your teen have younger siblings who need constant chauffeuring to appointments, clubs, and activities? Imagine being able to retire “Mom's Taxi” and delegating some of that responsibility to your well-trained, conscientious teen driver. You will have more time and more energy for yourself and you will help your teen develop a sense of responsibility and time management. </p>

					<h2>STEPS TO DRIVER LICENSURE IN CALIFORNIA</h2>
					<p>If your teenager is under 18 years old and wishes to obtain a driver's license in California, he or she must complete the following steps:</p>
					</div><!--text 3-->
					
					<div class="text-10">
					<ul>
					<li><span class="text-regular">1. Take an initial lesson with a certified driver education instructor.</span> This is MANDATORY for your teen to be able to drive with you or another California licensed driver. Without an initial lesson, their permit cannot be validated.</li>
					<li><span class="text-regular">2. Complete at least 6 hours of on-the-road instruction with a certified instructor.</span> We recommend 10-14 hours and offer affordable rates for these additional lessons.</li>
					<li><span class="text-regular">3. Complete 50 hours of on-the-road practice outside of a driver education program. </span> This is where you come in. Your teen needs to clock (and be able to document) 50 hours of practice behind the wheel with you or another California-licensed adult driver.</li>
					<li><span class="text-regular">4. Have a valid permit in good standing for at least 6 months.</span>This is a prerequisite for being able to schedule a road test.</li>
