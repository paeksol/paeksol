					<p>The short answer is: “It depends.” We don't think there's any such thing as too much practice. That's why we offer packages that put you behind the wheel for more hours and teach you more stuff. Here are the options we have for you: </p>

					<h2>“Why would I need more than six hours? I'm a really god driver.”</h2>
					<p>You know what? It's great that you're so confident. One thing we teach at Safety First is that nervous drivers are dangerous drivers and confident drivers are safe drivers. But it goes one step further: OVERCONFIDENT DRIVERS ARE THE MOST DANGEROUS. Don't be fooled by your own abilities. You may be a capable driver at 16 but becoming a GOOD driver takes three things: Practice, practice and more practice. At Safety First we believe that a balance of education, training and experience is the perfect recipe for making a good driver. That's why we recommend more lessons. It's nothing personal. </p>

					<h2>What having a Driver's License Says About You</h2>
						<p>The most important thing to remember is that a driver's license is not a status symbol. It is, however a symbol of a lot of important things in life. Getting a driver's license is, for most people your age, the first and most important step toward becoming an adult... a responsible adult.</p>
						<p>Having your license tells people:</p>
						<h2></h2>
						<ul>
						<li><span><img src="/media/img/arrow-left.png" alt=""/></span> You're officially NOT a kid anymore</li>
						<li><span><img src="/media/img/arrow-left.png" alt=""/></span> You're growing up and you can handle adult responsibilities</li>
						<li ><span><img src="/media/img/arrow-left.png" alt=""/></span> You are a great example and role model</li>
						<li ><span><img src="/media/img/arrow-left.png" alt=""/></span> You've earned a little independence and you can take care of yourself</li>
						</ul>

					<h2>SAFETY FIRST: Our Promise to YOU:</h2>
						<p>As your chosen driving school, we promise to:</p>
						<h2></h2>
						<ul>
						<li><span><img src="/media/img/arrow-left.png" alt=""/></span> Have you drive as much as possible and as far as possible during every lesson. We average over 35 miles of driving in a 2 hour lesson. We've got ALL the bases  Covered.</li>
						<li><span><img src="/media/img/arrow-left.png" alt=""/></span> Give you and your parents an honest and fair assessment of your progress every step of the way</li>
						<li ><span><img src="/media/img/arrow-left.png" alt=""/></span> Start your lessons on time, every time</li>
						<li ><span><img src="/media/img/arrow-left.png" alt=""/></span> Handle every situation that arises with cool and calm. Remember, this is supposed to be FUN so we promise not to stress you out!</li>
						<li ><span><img src="/media/img/arrow-left.png" alt=""/></span> Teach you how to drive, not just how to pass the road test. Seriously, aren't there are enough schools that take shortcuts like that (no pun intended)?</li>
