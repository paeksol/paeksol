					<h2>In Car Driver Training</h2>
					<p>Once the teen has completed Safety First’s driver education course and passed the DMV permit test, he or she can start the Safety First In Car driver’s training. </p>
					<p class="padding-cus">This portion of driver’s training is essential for teens to practice and apply their knowledge as a driver, and to get ready for the DMV drive test. Once scheduled, each teen will drive with a certified instructor who will educate him or her during In Car sessions. We have a diverse staff and can offer a female instructor upon request.</p>

					<h2>Scheduling & Pick Up</h2>
					<p>In Car driver training is available for scheduling 7 days a week from 7am to 10pm. Each lesson is two hours long. We offer pick-up at your home, our office, or school (Click Here for School Pick-Up locations ).</p>
					<p>Once your teen starts, try to schedule In Car lessons every month, except for the last lesson. Schedule the DMV drive test preparation lesson the same week as the DMV drive test. This will allow the final lesson to be fresh in the student’s mind.</p>

					<h2>Our Vehicles</h2>
					<p>Safety First uses late model Toyota Yaris and Nissan Sentras. All of our vehicles are equipped with a passenger side brake for the instructor so they can stop the vehicle if needed. Our airbags and other safety features help keep our students and instructors safe.</p>
					
					</div>
					
					<div class="text-3">
					<h2>Optimal and Safe Experience</h2>
					<p>While we strive to make everyone happy, sometimes it can take a while to schedule your driver training lesson. Safety First is very selective about instructors we hire, and we don’t skim through lessons or take shortcuts. Depending on your location and availability, and the location and availability of your instructor, there are occasions when it can be several weeks before a driver training lesson can be scheduled. Remember, you have to hold the permit for at least six months before you can take the drive test, so if you cannot get on the schedule for a few weeks, it won’t affect the date you can get your driver’s license.</p>
